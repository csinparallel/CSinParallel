# CSinParallel Code

CSinParallel is an NSF-funded project to support instructors seeking to add Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) to their undergraduate computer science courses.  The [csinparallel.org](https://csinparallel.org/index.html) website provides free resources towards this goal, including a number of teaching modules for inserting a few days of instruction on a PDC topic to a given course.

This public repository contains some of the code examples from the teaching modules that we use the most in our courses at various levels of the curriculum. We will be attempting to add to this repository over time.

The CSinParallel team is:

Dick Brown, St. Olaf College
Libby Shoop, Macalester College
Joel Adams, Calvin University
Suzanne Matthews, USMA West Point
