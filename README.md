# CSinParallel Code

CSinParallel is an NSF-funded project to support instructors seeking to add Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) to their undergraduate computer science courses.  

This public repository contains some of the code examples from the teaching modules that we use the most in our courses at various levels of the curriculum. We will be attempting to add to this repository over time.

Most of these code examples are also now available in online dynamic textbooks avaialble by visiting [learnpdc.org](https://www.learnpdc.org/).

The CSinParallel team is:

Dick Brown, St. Olaf College

Libby Shoop, Macalester College

Joel Adams, Calvin University

Suzanne Matthews, USMA West Point

### Original project site

The [csinparallel.org](https://csinparallel.org/index.html) website is our original resource for PDC teaching materials, including a number of teaching modules for inserting a few days of instruction on a PDC topic to a given course.
